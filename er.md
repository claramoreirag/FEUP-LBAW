# ER: Requirements specification

## Product vision
Our vision is to provide an accurate platform where sustainability is empowered through the sharing and discussion of related matters, to bring awareness to everyone.

## A1: Collaborative News - GreeNews

#### Goals, business context, and environment:
GreeNews intends to promote an online information system that can compile news from several collaborators about sustainability and the environment. This platform will be available to everyone interested in the environmental cause. It will stand out from similar platforms since our priority is to ensure the safety and accuracy of posted news. 

#### Motivation:
Now more than ever, there are pressing matters regarding the environment that make it to the newspaperâ€™s headlines every single day. We aim to provide a platform that can support updated news, have a solid base of verified information to educate people on these matters, and call for action. 

#### Main features:
GreeNews will have as the main feature a system where users can post and edit news regarding different topics inside the theme of sustainability. The users will also be able to comment on them, search by tags and upvote/downvote them. Additionally, users can sign up to this platform or sign in if they already have an account. To keep this platform organized, we will use the votes on each post to order them by relevance and create a list with the most pertinent news of the week. To promote a post, a user can share them on their social media or via email.
Users will be able to use advanced search criteria to order/filter the posts in their feed, such as top rated of the week, most recent posts, posts related to a certain topic, etc. When a user follows another account or tag, their personalized feed will feature posts from these accounts/tags. 
All the news posted can be reported by users if their sources are incorrect/untrusted or if they violate the platform's rules. They will later be checked by a moderator which will be able to delete them if need be. Ultimately, the moderator can also ban/suspend accounts.
The interface will be simple, objective, reliable as well as cross-platform, making the platform able to achieve its intended purpose. 

#### User profiles:
An authenticated user will be able to post news, comment on posts, search news by tags, and upvote/downvote posts or comments.
Google Authentication API can be used to log in/sign up in the platform.
A visitor or anonymous user is only able to see the feed and share news.
A writer is an authenticated user who writes posts or comments and has the ability to edit and delete them later. 
There will be an administrator user performing moderator tasks, analysing reported posts/comments to maintain a trustworthy platform with verified information, free of judgment. Additionally, they will manage all profiles on the platform, deleting and blocking accounts if necessary.

## A2: Actors and User stories

This artifact aims to describe the different actors that will interact with the GreeNews platform, as well as their user stories. This will help define the requirements and features of the project.

### 1. Actors

## A3. User Interface Prototype

The goals of this user interface prototype are to help identify and describe the user requirements while raising new ones. Additionally, it previews and tests the user interface of the product to be developed in further artifacts and enables fast and numerous interactions on the design of the user interface.

This artifact contains three elements as the overview of the interface elements and features common to all pages, the overview of the information architecture from the viewpoint of the users, using a sitemap, and, finally, identification and description of the main interactions with the system, organized as a sequence of screens.

**1. Interface and common features**

GreeNews is a website based on HTML, PHP, and CSS. We implemented the user interface with the Bootstrap framework.

- 1 - Logo
- 2 - Navbar
- 3 - Content
- 4 - Footer

**2. Sitemap**

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between the different pages of a website that shows how all the information fits together.

The sitemap gives the project team an idea of how the website is going to be built by helping to clarify the information hierarchy. 

![sitemaplbaw](uploads/69b974217864d8e95a8bd9e7cb475973/sitemaplbaw.png)

**3. WireFlows**

In this section, we present the Wireflows designed to effectively document the holistic user interaction. We show complete views of different pages using a series of wireframes connected by arrows representing the path taken and communicating the functionality.


**i)** *Wireflow centered on the visitor's options*

Starting at the GreeNews homepage you can see all the trending news ordered by the date. 
There are available several searching options: select tags, use the search bar to search for users or news, and reorder the news by the most upvoted news of the week. To know more about the website you can use the "About Us" button that will take you to a presentation page of the website. In the header, you can press the "Login" button that will take you to the Login Page or the "Sign Up" button in case you don't have an account.

Figure 3.1 - Wireflow centered on the visitor's options


**ii)** *Wireflow centered on the authenticated user's options*

Once you are authenticated you are back on the homepage, this time with one more searching option of seeing your personal feed. To write news you can press your username on the header that will take you to your Profile Page. 
Here you can see your own posts, the posts you upvoted and saved. You can also see your followers, the people you are following, and manage them. Pressing the "Edit Profile" button you will see a pop-up to do so. And to add your news you can press the "+" button on the corner. Once you press the "Publish" button on the New Post Page you are redirected to the homepage. Your news will appear on the top and you can press on "Read More" button to go to the Full Post Page. Here you can see all the comments among other interactions. Pressing the "Back" button you are back on the homepage. You can also reach the homepage by clicking on the logo of the navbar. Additionally, when scrolling through the posts you can press the Profile Picture of the writers to visit their profile page where you can follow them. Finally, you can start following a Tag by hovering the mouse on top of it on each post.

Figure 3.2 - Wireflow centered on the authenticated user's options

**iii)** *Wireflow centered on the administrator's options*

The Management Wireflow displays the interactions available to Administrators wich have Moderator roles. Here they can manage reported Posts and Comments as well as manage all the user's by pressing the "User Management" button on the header. By pressing on a row of the reported content table the administrator has access to a Full Post Page where he can take different actions.
